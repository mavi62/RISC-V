  <summary>Introduction to RISC-V ISA </summary>

  RISC-V ISA is a base integer ISA and must be present in any implemenatation along with some optional extension. The RISC-V has been designed to support extensive customization and specialization which can be extended  with  one  or  more  optional  instruction-set  extensions,  but  the  base  integer instructions cannot be redefine. The different instructions included in RISC-V are listed below.

1. Pseudo instructions - For e.g- mv,li,ret etc
2. Base integer instruction (RV64I, RV32I)-For e.g-lui,addi etc
3. Multiply extension (RV64M) -For e.g- mulw,divw etc
4. Single and double floating point instruction (RV64F, RV64D) -For e.g- flw,fadd etc
5. Application binary instruction 
6. Memory allocation and stack pointer

To know more about RISC-V check on this link [here](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf).

Each base integer set is characterized by the  width  of the register (XLEN) and size of the user address space. The most important advantage of RISC-V is that it is an open standard instruction which is easily available for academics and commercial purposes free of cost.

  <summary>Application Software on Hardware Flow</summary>

![1](https://github.com/mavi62/IIITB_VLSI/assets/57127783/a043fef4-b35c-4a18-b31e-a7bc8e9e6a93)

When a C program needs to run on a hardware chip, it goes through a series of steps. First, the C program is turned into assembly language, specifically RISCV assembly language in this case. Then, this assembly language is transformed into machine language consisting of 0s and 1s. These binary instructions are what the chip understands and executes. There's a bridge between the RISCV assembly language and the physical layout of the chip. This bridge is made using Hardware Description Language, which is more closely related to the hardware's workings. To create a RISC specification, the architecture needs to be implemented in a way that registers transfer data. This process involves converting from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to the layout, a process known as RTL to GDSII flow. This ensures that all applications function properly on the hardware.

To make an application work on the hardware, it has to pass through the software system. Here, the system software comes into play, which includes the Operating System (OS), compiler, and assembler. The OS handles tasks like input/output and memory allocation, while the compiler turns the high-level code (like C or C++) into a set of instructions. These instructions depend on the hardware's structure. For a RISC-V system, the instructions follow the RISC-V architecture. The assembler then takes these instructions and turns them into a binary form, which is basically a machine language program. This binary representation is what the hardware ultimately receives and processes. These instructions act as a link between the C language and the intricate hardware components. This link is formally called the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). In hardware's language, only 0s and 1s make sense, and they serve as the foundation for communication between software and hardware.

  <summary>Illustration of the RISC-V gnu toolchain</summary>

#### O1 mode 
Consider the simple C program given below which calculates the sum of the number form 1 to n. 

```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i ,sum=0,n=9;
    for (i=1;i<=n;i++)
        sum+=i;
    printf("The sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n",n,sum);
    return 0;
}
```
In order to map this command to riscv based assembly language compile it using the riscv-gnu-toolchain shown below

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton_O1.o sum1ton.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton_O1.o | less
spike pk sum1ton_O1.o 
```

**Output of the disassembled file**

To debug line by line
```
spike -d pk sum1ton_O1.o

reg 0 a2
```

**Output of the spike in debug mode is shown below :**

#### Ofast mode
Consider the same [C program] given in the O1 mode.

In order to map this command to riscv based assembly language compile it in Ofast mode using the riscv-gnu-toolchain shown below

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton_Ofast.o sum1ton.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton_Ofast.o | less
spike pk sum1ton_Ofast.o 
```

**Output of the disassembled file**

  <summary>Data Representation</summary>

![5](https://github.com/mavi62/IIITB_VLSI/assets/57127783/b1befeba-19f4-4b92-b3fc-6d485c836ffc)

In RISC-V and computer architecture in general, several terms relate to data representation and storage. Let's explore them:

1. **Byte:** - A byte is the fundamental unit of data storage and representation in computers. It consists of 8 bits and can represent a single character or value.

2. **Word:** - A word typically refers to the natural data size that a processor operates with. In RISC-V, the term "word" can vary based on the architecture. For example, in RV32 (32-bit architecture), a word is 4 bytes (32 bits), while in RV64 (64-bit architecture), a word is 8 bytes (64 bits).

3. **Double Word:** - A double word is twice the size of a word. In RISC-V, for example, in RV32, a double word is 8 bytes (64 bits), and in RV64, a double word is 16 bytes (128 bits).

4. **Least Significant Bit (LSB):** -  The least significant bit is the lowest-order bit in a binary representation. 

5. **Most Significant Bit (MSB):** -  The most significant bit is the highest-order bit in a binary representation. It has the greatest influence on the overall value of a number. The MSB is the bit that represents the largest power of two.


6. **Endianess:** - Endianess refers to how multi-byte data is stored in memory. In a big-endian system, the most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address, while in a little-endian system, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address. RISC-V supports both big-endian and little-endian modes.

7. **Byte addressing** -  is a memory addressing scheme used in computer systems to identify and access individual bytes of data within the computer's memory. In byte addressing, each individual byte in the memory has a unique address, allowing direct access to and manipulation of single bytes of data. In RISC-V, like in many other computer architectures, memory is byte-addressable.

Understanding these terms is crucial when working with data representation, memory allocation, and programming in computer systems, including the RISC-V architecture.

  <summary>Representation of Signed and Unsigned Numbers</summary>

#### Unsigned Numbers
Unsigned numbers donâ€™t have any sign, these can contain only magnitude of the number. So, representation of unsigned binary numbers are all positive numbers only.
Since there is no sign bit in this unsigned binary number, so N bit binary number represent its magnitude only. Zero (0) is also unsigned number. Every number in unsigned number representation has only one unique binary equivalent form, so this is unambiguous representation technique. The range of unsigned binary number is from  **0 to ((2^n)-1)**.

Consider the C code given below which demostrates the maximum unsigned number the RV64I can store. 

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{
    unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,64)-1); //Line 1
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,127)-1);// Line 2
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,64)*-1);// Line 3
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(-2,64)-1);// Line 4
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(-2,63)-1);// Line 5
    // unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int)(pow(2,10)-1);// Line 6
    printf("Highest number represented by unsigned long long  int is %llu \n",max);
    return 0;
}
```
___
***Note***</br>

**%llu** - is the format specifier for 64-bit unsigned integer.

**%lld** - is the format specifier for 64-bit signed integer.

Uncomment the lines in the code appropriately and view the result.
___

- Line 1 will execute and give the result of (2^64)-1.</br>
- Line 2 will execute and give the result of (2^64)-1 instead of (2^127)-1 since the maximum unsigned value that can be stored in the 64 bit register is (2^64)-1.</br>
- Line 3 will execute and give the result of 0 instead of -(2^64) since the minimum unsigned value that can be stored in 64 bit register is 0.</br>
- Line 4 will execute and give the result of 0 instead of (2^64)-1.</br>
- Line 5 will execute and give the result of 0 instead of -(2^64) since the minimum unsigned value that can be stored in 64 bit register is 0.</br>
- Line 6 will execute and give the result of 1024 since the value of max is less that (2^64)-1.

To compile and execute the C code in RISC-V gnu toolchain follow the steps given below:

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o unsign_num_new.o unsign_num.c 
spike  pk unsign_num_new.o 
```

**Output of the execution**

#### Signed Numbers
Generally 2's complement representation is used for the signed numbers. 2â€™s complement of a number is obtained by inverting each bit of given number plus 1 to least significant bit (LSB). So, positive numbers are represented in binary form and negative numbers are represented in 2â€™s complement form. There is extra bit for sign representation. If value of sign bit is 0, then number is positive and you can directly represent it in simple binary form, but if value of sign bit 1, then number is negative and 2â€™s complement of given binary number should be taken. In this representation, zero (0) has only one (unique) representation which is always positive. The range of 2â€™s complement form is from  **(-2^(n-1))  to ((2^(n-1))-1)**.

Consider the C code given below which demostrates the maximum and minimum signed number the RV64I can store. 


```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main()
{
    long long int max = (long long int)(pow(2,63)-1);
    long long int min = (long long int)(pow(-2,63));
    printf("Highest number represented by long long  int is %lld \n",max);
    printf("Smallest number represented by long long  int is %lld \n",min);
    return 0;
}
```
To compile and execute the C code in RISC-V gnu toolchain follow the steps given below:

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sign_num_new.o sign_num.c 
spike  pk sign_num_new.o 
```

**Output of the execution**

  <summary>RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set</summary>

RV64I is the base integer instruction set for the 64-bit architecture, which builds upon the RV32I variant. RV64I shares most of the instructions with RV32I but the width of registers is different and there are a few additional instructions only in RV64I. The base integer instruction set has 47 instructions (35 instructions from RV32I and 12 instructions from RV64I). The instructions and their format is shown below :

![1](https://github.com/mavi62/IIITB_VLSI/assets/57127783/0a96e1a2-3aa1-4d59-8459-9be37e06a661)

There are 31 general-purpose registers x1â€“x31, which hold integer values. Register x0 is hardwired to the constant 0. There is no hardwired subroutine return address link register, but the standard software calling convention uses register x1 to hold the return address on a call. For RV32, the x registers are 32 bits wide, and for RV64, they are 64 bits wide. The term XLEN to refer to the current width of an x register in bits (either 32 or 64).

![2](https://github.com/mavi62/IIITB_VLSI/assets/57127783/4a395dcc-69b8-4632-9947-d52023c13d22)

![3](https://github.com/mavi62/IIITB_VLSI/assets/57127783/d83a432e-e7dd-4455-ae84-8a6b9075ce7d)

In the RISC-V instruction set architecture, instructions are categorized into different formats based on their opcode and operand types. These formats are denoted by single-letter abbreviations. Here's an explanation of each type:

- **R-Type (Register Type)** -  These instructions involve operations that operate on two source registers and store the result in a destination register. They include arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operations. The typical format is: opcode rd, rs1, rs2.

- **I-Type (Immediate Type)** - These instructions have an immediate (constant) value as one of their operands, and they work with a source register to perform operations like arithmetic, logical, and memory operations. The typical format is: opcode rd, rs1, imm.

- **S-Type (Store Type)** - S-type instructions are used for storing data into memory. They combine a source register, a destination address (base register), and an immediate offset to determine where the data should be stored. The typical format is: opcode rs2, imm(rs1).

- **B-Type (Branch Type)** - B-type instructions are used for conditional branching. They compare values from two source registers and use an immediate offset to determine the branching target. These instructions support operations like equality, inequality, and comparison. The typical format is: opcode rs1, rs2, imm.

- **U-Type (Upper Immediate Type)** - U-type instructions are used for loading immediate values into registers. They include unconditional jump instructions. These instructions operate on a single source register and use an immediate value to specify the upper bits of the result. The typical format is: opcode rd, imm.

- **J-Type (Jump Type)** J-type instructions are used for unconditional jumps. They involve using an immediate offset to determine the target address of the jump. These instructions are typically used for implementing function calls and other control flow changes. The typical format is: opcode rd, imm.

The instruction format for all types is shown below :

  <summary>Application Binary Interface (ABI)</summary>

The ABI is a set of rules that govern how software components, like programs and libraries, interact with each other at the binary level. It defines things like how data is passed between different parts of a program, how function calls are made, and how data structures are organized in memory. The ABI ensures compatibility between different parts of a software ecosystem, making it possible for programs to work together seamlessly even if they're written in different languages or compiled by different compilers. The application program can directly access the registers of the RISC V architecture using system calls. The ABI also known as system call interface enables the application to access the hardware resources via registers.A system call is a specific request your program makes to the operating system to perform a task it can't do on its own. For example, if your program needs to read a file, it would make a system call to ask the operating system to read the file and give it the data. System calls are a way for programs to access the more powerful features of the operating system while staying within the rules defined by the ABI. The ISA is inherently divided into two parts: User & System ISA and User ISA the latter is available to the user directly by system calls.

  <summary>Illustration of ABI</summary>

Consider the C code given below which calculates the sum from 1 to 9 :
```
#include<stdio.h>

extern int load(int x, int y);

int main()
{
    int result = 0;
    int count = 9;
    result = load(0x0,count+1);
    printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n",count,result);
    
}
```

Consider the assembly code (ASM) given below :
```
.section .text 
.global load
.type load, @function

load:
    add a4, a0, zero
    add a2, a0, a1
    add a3, a0, zero
loop : add a4, a3, a4
       addi a3, a3, 1
       blt a3, a2, loop
       add a0, a4, zero
       ret
```
The flow chart of the function performed by ASM code is shown below :

To illustrate the ABI the C code shown above will send the values to the ASM code through the function load and the ASM code will perform the function and return the value to C code and the value is displayed by the C code.

**Steps to perform the lab task mentioned above**

## Day 3

<details >
<summary >Introduction</summary>

TL-Verilog was used as the HDL of choice for this project. Projects on Makerchip can be completely designed using TL-Verilog. Transaction Level - Verilog standard is an extension of Verilog which has various advantages like simpler syntax, shorter codes and easy pipelining. You can learn more about TL-Verilog [here](http://tl-x.org/).

Timing abstract can be done in TL-Verilog. This model is specified for pipelines where the sequential elements are generated by tools from the pipelined specification. This allows for easy retiming without the risk of introduction of any functional bugs. More information on timing abstract in TL-Verilog can be found in the IEEE paper ["Timing-Abstract Circuit Design in Transaction-Level Verilog" by Steven Hoover](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8119264).

A sequential circuit is a type of digital circuit that employs memory elements to store information and produce outputs based not only on the current input values but also on the circuit's previous state. Unlike combinational circuits, which generate outputs solely based on the present input values, sequential circuits incorporate feedback loops and memory elements like flip-flops or registers to maintain and utilize their internal state.

## Fibonacci Series

The TL-Verilog code for fibonacci series is shown below :
```
   $reset = *reset;
   $num[31:0] = $reset ? 1 : (>>1$num + >>2$num);
```

The block diagram of the fibonacci series generator is shown below :

## Sequential Calculator

The TL-verilog code for sequential calculator is shown below :

```
   $reset = *reset;
   
   $cnt2[2:0] = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$cnt2 + 1);
   $cnt3[1:0] = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$cnt3 + 1);
   
   $op[1:0] = $cnt3;
   
   $val1[31:0] = >>1$out;
   $val2[31:0] = $cnt2;
   $sum[31:0] = $val1+$val2;
   $diff[31:0] = $val1-$val2;
   $prod[31:0] = $val1*$val2;
   $div[31:0] = $val1/$val2;
   
   $out[31:0] = $reset ? 32'h0 : ($op[1] ? ($op[0] ? $div : $prod):($op[0] ? $diff : $sum));
```

This code works like the normal calculator in which the result of the previous operation is considered as one of the operand for the next operation. Upon reset the result becomes zero.

<summary >Pipelining</summary>

Pipelining is a technique used in computer architecture and digital system design to enhance the efficiency of processing by dividing a complex task into smaller, sequential stages. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data, and these stages are arranged in a pipeline. Pipelining enables multiple instructions or tasks to be executed concurrently, with different stages of different instructions being processed simultaneously. In a pipelined architecture, the processing of an instruction is divided into several stages. This allows for overlapping the execution of multiple instructions, reducing the overall time needed to complete a sequence of tasks.

## Validity

In Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog), validity is a concept used to track the state and timing of transactions within a design description. In TL-Verilog, transactions are used to represent higher-level actions or events that occur in a design. A transaction typically consists of a set of signals that represent the data and control information associated with that action. Validity, refers to whether a transaction is considered "valid" or "invalid" based on the state of its associated signals.

## Clock Gating

Clock gating is a power-saving technique used in digital circuit design to reduce power consumption by controlling the clock signal distribution to specific circuit blocks. The goal of clock gating is to minimize unnecessary clock transitions in parts of a circuit that are not actively performing computations or tasks, thus conserving energy. In digital systems, the clock signal is used to synchronize the operations of various components within the circuit. However, not all components need to be active and consuming power during every clock cycle. In fact, many components spend a significant amount of time in idle or low-power states. Clock gating takes advantage of this fact by selectively enabling or disabling the clock signal to certain portions of the circuit based on their activity status. The basic idea of clock gating involves inserting a logic gate (often an AND gate) in the clock path. The control signal for this gate determines whether the clock signal is allowed to pass through or not. If the control signal is active (high), the clock gate is open, and the clock signal reaches the circuit block. If the control signal is inactive (low), the clock gate is closed, effectively stopping the clock from reaching the circuit block.

## Distance Accumulator

The block diagram of the distance accumulator is shown below :

![26](https://github.com/mavi62/IIITB_VLSI/assets/57127783/7adb576b-cb75-45da-84d4-a6efb786dabe)

The TL-Verilog code is given below:

``` 
    |calc
      @1
         $reset = *reset;
      ?$valid
         @1
            $aa_sq[31:0] = $aa[3:0] * $aa;
            $bb_sq[31:0] = $bb[3:0] * $bb;
         @2
            $cc_sq[31:0] = $aa_sq + $bb_sq;
         @3
            $out[31:0] = sqrt($cc_sq);
       @4
          $tot_dist[31:0] = $reset ? '0 : ($valid ? (>>1$tot_dist + $out) : $RETAIN);
```

Once the valid signal is asserted the previous value of result will be added with the current value and it result will get updated otherwise the previous value is retained.
